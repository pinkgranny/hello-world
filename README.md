PinkGranny trying out with her first Git reposatory ever!
Introducing the new Tesla Model S P100D of coding that gets excited from 0-100 faster than the Tesla's 2.28 seconds -and holds up the speed. Having worked on the business side for long enough it dawned on me that I'd better get myself great coding skills if I want to continue with not only my work in a startup but also in my new dear hobby of arduinos and robots:)
